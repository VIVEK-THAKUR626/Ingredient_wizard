    <h2>About Ingredients Wizard</h2>
    <p>
        Ingredients Wizard is a smart and intuitive web application designed to help you discover delicious recipes using ingredients you already have at home. Whether you're trying to clean out your fridge, cook on a budget, or simply avoid another trip to the store, Ingredients Wizard empowers you to turn everyday ingredients into exciting meals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our platform goes beyond simple recipe searching. With built-in filters for dietary preferences (like vegan, gluten-free, or keto) and ethnic cuisines from around the world, we personalize your cooking experience based on your tastes and needs. You can also save your favorite recipes into custom lists, making it easier to plan meals, shop smarter, and cook healthier.

        But Ingredients Wizard isn't just about convenience — it's about impact. By helping people make the most of what they already have, we aim to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce food waste by encouraging creative use of leftover or forgotten ingredients.</li>
        <li>Promote mindful eating with a focus on dietary needs and balanced nutrition.</li>
        <li>Inspire home cooks with fresh meal ideas and easy access to global flavors.</li>
        <li>Simplify meal planning for students, busy professionals, and families alike.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We believe that cooking should be joyful, resourceful, and accessible to everyone — and Ingredients Wizard is here to make that possible, one ingredient at a time.
